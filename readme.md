## by (Shahad Aljurbua)


## Dataset

> The dataset is a suicide rates overview from 1985 to 2016 with considering different variables such as country, age, sex. The dataset can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016


## Summary of Findings

> In doing exploration, I used the suicide rate as my main variable. I found a strong relationship between age and suicide rates. The older the age, the higher the suicide rate. Also, It was noticed that the global suicide rate reached its peak in 1995. Further, males have a high rate of suicide comparing to females especially after 1995. 

Considering countries, Russia has the largest number of suicides globally followed by Lithuania, Hungary, Kazakhstan and Korea. 


## Key Insights for Presentation
For the presentation, I focused on the  the influence of the variables (age,sex,year,and country) on the suicide rate. I started by introducing the
year variable in a line chart, followed by age variable, then sex and finally the countries .

The, I introduced a scatterplot for the suicide trend over the years with the distribution of sex. and finally a line plot for suicide trend over the years with the distribution of age.
